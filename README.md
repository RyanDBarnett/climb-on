# Climb On

Climb on is an application that allows a user to search the Colorado area for a place to climb, an area to climb, and a route to climb. It allows a user to sort routes by difficulty or type of climbing available. 

## About

This project is a collection of Colorado climbing areas and their associated routes. The project was inspired by a recent climbing trip, where a full climbing book was carried around all day. Users are able to search by an area they are interested in, either by name directly or by a nearby city.

The purpose of the project was to become familiar with making `fetch` requests, as well as learning the fundamentals of React with testing from Jest and Enzyme.

Here is a photo of the layout, with Boulder as a search term. Favorited routes can be seen.
